## Unreleased

- The published package contains only the runtime build output; test files and TypeScript build info are no longer included. [#3348](https://github.com/a2ui-project/a2ui/pull/3348)
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Hosts set up the catalog once with `configureMcpCatalog`; `createCallMcpToolImplementation`, `CallMcpToolApi` and `A2UI_MIME_TYPE` are removed and `MCP_CATALOG_ID` now identifies the v1.0 catalog (`catalogs/mcp/v1/catalog.json`, bundled as `@a2ui/catalog-mcp/catalog.json`). `callMcpTool` now hands `ui://` MCP App resources to the host. [#3186](https://github.com/a2ui-project/a2ui/pull/3186)

## 0.0.1-alpha.1

- `@a2ui/catalog-mcp` provides `callMcpTool`: it runs a tool on a connected MCP server, returns the raw result, and applies the A2UI messages found in the result and in the UI resources it references to the host's `MessageProcessor`. [#3171](https://github.com/a2ui-project/a2ui/pull/3171)
